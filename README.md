# Knee-Bending-Medical-Exercise-Rep-Counter-and-Timer
This project is a knee bend exercise rep counter and timer built using the Mediapipe library. The system monitors knee angles and initiates a timer when the angle is below 135 degrees, requiring a minimum of 8 seconds to complete one repetition. It tracks and displays total reps, time elapsed, and provides interactive feedback messages.
